From previous abstract
- Amazon Web Services offers a single-tenant HSM product 
- The single-tenancy is important because it guarantees that only the intended customer will be able to access the key
- It is possible to use cheaper Key Management Systems (KMS) but the single-tenancy is not guaranteed. 
- Where an organisation needs to be audited, there has to be certainty over access and thus a single-tenant service provides enough confidence.
